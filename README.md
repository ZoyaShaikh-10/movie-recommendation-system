# movie-recommendation-system
 Recommendation System is a filtration program whose prime goal is to predict the “rating” or “preference” of a user towards a domain-specific item or item.  In this case, the main focus of our recommendation system is to filter and predict only those movies which a user would prefer given some data about the user him or herself.
